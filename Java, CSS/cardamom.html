    <dd id="p1">Cardamom is a spice in the same family as ginger and turmeric. When used in tea, blends usually contain either whole cardamom pods or cardamom seeds, both of which have a spicy, warm flavor.

        Green cardamom is most commonly used in tea blends, but some may also feature black cardamom, which is darker and slightly smokier.</dd>
