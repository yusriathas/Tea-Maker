    <dd>Black Tea is generally bolder and stronger in taste than green tea. It has a rich flavour with a distinct bouquet and aroma and a dark red or brown hue. When brewed correctly it has a balanced and smooth taste that is full of natural goodness and perfect for everyday drinking. Black tea is the variety of tea that has gone through the standard manufacturing process of withering, rolling, fermentation and drying. It is the fermentation process of the fresh tea shoots that gives the tea its recognisable black colour. Black tea has antioxidants which helps towards a healthy lifestyle, with benefits said to include, a lower risk of diabetes, healthy bones, increased energy and stress relief, if consumed on a regular basis.</dd>
